							<h2 class="major">The difference in speed and accuracy between using controllers and hand tracking in a VR pick-up-and-place interaction.</h2>
							<h3>Abstract</h3>
							<p>When using virtual reality (VR), as a
								player, you’ve got two choices of how you
								interact with the virtual world. On the one
								hand, you have controllers, on the other hand,
								you have hand tracking. This brings forth the
								question: “Which of these two interaction types
								is better?”.
								The question of which of the two
								interaction types, controllers or hand tracking,
								is better, redefined into a more researchable
								format: “What are the differences between the
								interaction types: controllers and hand
								tracking; when it comes to speed and accuracy
								of interactions?” will be examined by
								conducting an experiment where the
								participant must pick up and place a mug in a
								specific location repeatedly as fast as possible
								within a set time frame.
								My hypothesis is that controllers
								outperform hand tracking in both categories:
								speed and accuracy; in every way.
								The results show controllers only
								outperforming hand tracking in speed and two
								out of three accuracy categories. While hand
								tracking outperforms controllers in one of the
								three accuracy categories.
								Using these results I can refute my
								hypothesis of controllers outperforming hand
								tracking in both the speed and accuracy
								categories.</p>

							<h2 class="major">A study on increasing Non Player Character realism by leveraging Large Language Model capabilities.</h2>
							<h3>Abstract</h3>
							<p>This paper examines whether implementing  large language models (LLMs) into non-player characters (NPCs) can increase their experienced realism, which will be tested by implementing an LLM into the passenger NPCs in the KLM extended reality center of excellence’s virtual reality communication training.
								First, how can the realism of NPCs be defined? There is no agreed upon definition of NPC realism, however in this paper, perceived believability will be used to judge the realism of the NPCs.
								The passenger NPCs have to adhere to certain criteria to be perceived as believable, these include being able to deceive the player, convey values from the historical column of the game agent matrix and the NPC should be perceived as possibly existing in their own social environment.
							The next question to be answered is whether an LLM can make an NPC adhere to these criteria. At this moment, LLMs vary widely in their conversational abilities, making it difficult to determine whether an LLM will be able to achieve the high complexity of social context required for it to be perceived as believable, however, an NPC might still benefit from the emergent behaviour introduced by the LLM.
							To answer this question, an experiment was conducted where an NPC whose responses are generated using an LLM is compared to an NPC whose responses are predetermined.
							This experiment’s results show that the biggest influence actually came from the addition of being able to speak to NPCs through voice. In addition, being able to choose freely what to say, instead of having to choose between multiple options also had a positive influence.
							The introduction of the LLM did cause some unrealistic behaviour in the NPC’s responses, which was a negative influence. Additionally, the extra time it takes for the LLM to respond does not affect the experienced realism in a significant way, however, further research will be necessary to support this claim.
